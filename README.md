## What is IncBL?

IncBL (**Inc**remental **B**ug **L**ocalization) is an efficient information retrieval-based bug localization tool that can store and update model incrementally to save running time. IncBL is implemented as an open-source GitHub app that can analyze the issues labelled as **bug** and comment with the suspicious code files to remind developers.

## What are IncBL's features?

IncBL focuses on improving the efficiency by combining two main features:

- IncBL refactors BugLocator with multiple-processing feature. It also utilizes bug history information and file length normalization to enhance accuracy, but can run 20 times faster than original BugLocator.
- IncBL can store the Incremental update.

IncBL can be installed as an GitHub app in any GitHub repository. IncBL can also be locally-deployed as a docker tool.
